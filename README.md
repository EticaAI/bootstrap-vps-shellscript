# Bootstrap VPS Shell Script

> UPDATE 2019-07-11: I was wrong. For who did not liked Puppet in the past, check at least Ansible. Even for small setups (and ones that already do not have other automation), it can be very, very productive. Maybe one of the few things this repository could still be great was for prepare a machine that does not have autentication with ssh keys be prepared to allow automation with Ansible.
